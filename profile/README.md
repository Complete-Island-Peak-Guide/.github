# Island Peak Climbing Guide

## Introduction

Island Peak, locally known as Imja Tse, is a popular trekking peak situated in Nepal’s renowned Everest Region. Standing tall at 6,189 meters, this peak offers an ideal mountaineering experience for beginners. Named by Eric Shipton in 1953, the peak looks like an island amidst a sea of ice when viewed from Dingboche. This adventure combines trekking and mountaineering with breathtaking views of Everest, Ama Dablam, Lhotse, and Nuptse.

## Trip Overview

Unlike longer treks in Nepal, the Island Peak expedition usually takes under 20 days. The journey begins with a scenic flight from Kathmandu to Lukla. From Lukla, trekkers proceed through the Khumbu Valley, passing through traditional Sherpa villages. A turn from Dingboche leads towards Island Peak.

The climb is not extremely technical but does include glacier travel, rope work, and a steep snow wall. Climbers need basic mountaineering skills, and while the peak isn't the most challenging, its altitude and physical demands make it moderately difficult.

## Key Highlights
